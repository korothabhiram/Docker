# 🐳 Docker

## 📘 What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers and system administrators to build, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable **containers**. These containers package an application with everything it needs to run—code, runtime, libraries, and system tools—ensuring consistency across different environments.

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Who Should Use Docker?

- **Developers**: Simplify setup and eliminate "it works on my machine" problems.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Automate builds, deployments, and infrastructure.
- **Sysadmins**: Standardize environments and isolate apps securely.
- **QA Engineers**: Reproduce bug environments quickly and reliably.
- **Tech Learners**: Experiment with stacks like Node.js, Python, MySQL, etc., in isolated environments.

## 🎯 Why Use Docker?

- 🧳 Package once, run anywhere
- 🚀 Rapid deployment and scaling
- 🔁 Version-controlled infrastructure
- 🛠️ Easy CI/CD and testing pipelines
- 💡 Lightweight and fast
